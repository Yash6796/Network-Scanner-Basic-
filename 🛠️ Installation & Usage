1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

pip install scapy
2️⃣ Run the Scanner

python network_scanner.py -t 192.168.1.1/24
🔹 Replace 192.168.1.1/24 with your target subnet to scan your network.

💻 Example Output

Scanning network...
IP Address       MAC Address
-------------------------------------
192.168.1.1     00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
192.168.1.2     00:1B:3C:5D:6E:7F
192.168.1.3     00:2C:4D:6E:8F:9G


🔧 How It Works
The script sends ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests to all IPs in the subnet.
It waits for responses and collects IP & MAC addresses of active devices.
Displays the results in a clear format.
